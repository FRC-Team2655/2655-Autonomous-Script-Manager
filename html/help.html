		<h1>Use of the Manager:</h1>
		<h3>Files:</h3>
		<p>On the top bar there is a drop-down box. This will show all files in the autonomous directory. Beside the drop-down is a refresh button. This is to rescan the autonomous directory for new files or removed files. On the right side of the top there is a new, rename and delete button. It is mostly obvious what these buttons do. New creates a file, rename renames a file, and delete moves a file to the backup directory.</p>
		<p>On the bottom there are four buttons. A save button to save the file, a discard button to discard the changed. You MUST press the discard button to discard changes. Changing the file in the drop-down will save the file. The save and check button will save the file then check the commands and arguments. The help button shows this page.</p>
		<h3>Editing:</h3>
		<p>On the right side in the pallet there are all the available commands. In the table there will be the command name, argument, and what the argument should be. Only the argument column can be edited. On the left there are table command buttons. Up moves the selected row up, down moves it down, and delete deletes it.</p>
		<h3>File System:</h3>
		<p>On the desktop there is a directory called Autonomous. This is where all the .csv files that are the routines. In that folder there is a folder called Backup. The deleted files get added to the Backup folder with a time stamp when delete is pressed in the manager. In the user directory there is a folder called Autonomous-BAK. This has the latest version of all (even deleted) files.</p>
